# Machine-Learning-CA

This analysis is based on a classification data set research of over 120,000 airline passengers' satisfaction. It will study what factors are highly correlated to dissatisfaction with short-haul passengers. 
It will describe the motivation of the chosen data, a description of the business problem and an explanation of the project goal. It will present the characterisation of the data by applying Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA), filling in the missing values, observing the outliers by plotting boxplots, and using the feature selection model to extract the influencing factors of passenger dissatisfaction by using machine learning accuracy. Afterwards, cross-validation techniques will be applied by using machine learning approaches, hyperparameters and a comparison between the chosen model. And finally, the interpretation and explanation of the results obtained based on different classification models.
